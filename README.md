# Hello! Welcome to Nutshell

### What is Nutshell?
Nutshell is a collaborative group effort to build a MVP prototype of a social media site that allows a user to add/remove/edit articles, events, tasks, messages (chatroom style), and add other users as friends. Users have the ability to add a photo of themselves, a bio, and a birthdate to simulate a more familiar social media experience.

### Why is Nutshell?
Imagine you are going through a software developer bootcamp, and at the end of your front-end web development course, you are assigned to a 4 person team and told to culminate everything youve learned thus far into a single project, alongside your teammates, and in a cohesive agile/scrum process.

Next, the project must be coded in React.js, a language you just learned last week.

Lastly, you have 5 days to build it.

### The Code!

Nutshell is built in React.js and setup with `npx create-react-app`.It utilizes BOTH of the ReactStrap (Bootstrap for React) and Bloomer (Bulma for React) style libraries for various features and visual effects throughout the project.
I simple, flat datastructure (JSON file) is hosted off of a JSON server. [The Server can be viewed here!](https://github.com/Party-Pengiuins/nutshell-server)

#### How to pull down the project:
Fork the repo and choose to clone the project
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Party-Pengiuins/penguin-nutshell.git
```
Then once you are into the project, from the root level run
```sh
npm install
```
to get the proper packages installed
